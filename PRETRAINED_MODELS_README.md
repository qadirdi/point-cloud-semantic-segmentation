### Combined Canonical Classes (25 classes)
The system maps all dataset-specific classes to a unified canonical class system that includes all classes from both datasets.

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Automatic Model Selection (Recommended)

The system automatically selects the best model based on your point cloud characteristics:

```python
from pointroad.pointroad.ml.infer import run_segmentation

# Automatic model selection
result = run_segmentation(pcd, method="auto")
```

### 2. Specific Model Selection

Choose a specific model for your use case:

```python
# For urban environments
result = run_segmentation(pcd, method="pretrained", model_name="pointnet2_toronto3d")

# For road scenes
result = run_segmentation(pcd, method="pretrained", model_name="pointnet2_semantickitti")

# For large-scale urban scenes
result = run_segmentation(pcd, method="pretrained", model_name="randla_net_toronto3d")
```

### 3. Ensemble Segmentation

Combine multiple models for improved accuracy:

```python
from pointroad.pointroad.ml.enhanced_infer import run_ensemble_segmentation

result = run_ensemble_segmentation(pcd)
```

### 4. Model Recommendations

Get recommendations based on dataset type:

```python
from pointroad.pointroad.ml.model_loader import get_recommended_model

# For urban scenes
model = get_recommended_model("toronto3d")  # Returns "pointnet2_toronto3d"

# For road scenes
model = get_recommended_model("semantickitti")  # Returns "pointnet2_semantickitti"

# For general use
model = get_recommended_model("general")  # Returns "pointnet2_toronto3d"
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Model Download Fails
```bash
# Check internet connection
# Verify Hugging Face Hub access
# Check disk space in ~/.cache/pointroad/models/
```

#### CUDA Out of Memory
```bash
# Models automatically fall back to CPU
# Reduce point cloud size if needed
# Check available GPU memory
```

#### Import Errors
```bash
# Install missing dependencies
pip install torch torchvision scikit-learn huggingface-hub
```

### Performance Tips
1. **Use GPU**: Install CUDA-enabled PyTorch for faster inference
2. **Optimize Point Count**: Downsample to ~100k points for best performance
3. **Choose Right Model**: Use Toronto3D models for urban scenes
4. **Enable Caching**: Models are cached automatically after first download
